# @apollographql/graphql-upload-8-fork changelog

See [the upstream changelog](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload/blob/master/changelog.md) for more details.

## 8.1.3

Depend on the `@types` packages required to use the typings from this package. (Because this fork is intended only for use by the TypeScript project Apollo Server, this seems reasonable.)

## 8.1.2

Incorporate typings from DefinitelyTyped.

## 8.1.1

Add v15 to the graphql peerDependencies.
